# Setsudo
Moderation and utility bot for the r/smashbros Discord server

## Self-hosting

Self-hosting can be enabled by setting the `selfhost` config setting to `true`, but no support is provided. 

This will disable all server-specific commands.

## Configuration and Startup

Rename `config.example.json` to `config.json` and fill in the values.

Run `npm start` to create the bot instance.
